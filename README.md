# Project 1: Film data correlation analysis
* Analyse movies data from iMDb to find correlation between budget, gross profit, production companies, ratings, etc
* Created a correlation table that shows and visualises correlation between film budget, gross profit, production companies, ratings, etc to better understand the movie industry.
* Scraped over 5,000 movie titles from Rotten Tomatoes, an American review-aggregation website for film and television using python.
* Optimized numpy, seaborn, matplotlib to analyse the correlation between various data and visualise the result.

*Findings: 
1. Votes and budgets have the highest correlation to gross earnings.
2. Production company has low correlation vs gross earnings
