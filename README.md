# Project 1: Film data correlation analysis
**Project overview:**
* Find correlation of gross profit vs budget, production companies and ratings by analysing over 5,000 film titles from 1980-2020 with data scrape from iMDb. 
* Visualise data using correlation matrix heatmap, regression plot and scatter plot.  
* Optimized numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, pandas for data cleaning and preprocessing, data analysis and visualisation.

**Findings:** 
1. Votes and budgets have the highest correlation to gross earnings.
2. Production company has low correlation to gross earnings.
